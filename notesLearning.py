***** Unsupervised vs. Supervised Learning *****

Unsupervised: you don't give it any answers it can learn from.
> these algorithms try to find patterns in your data on their own
> these pattern discoverd for example in "clustering" are called latent variablkes
> examples: clustering movies via their properties and look by what mertrics they cluster together

Supervised: we have a set of answers the model can learn from
> Evaluation: two groups, a larger group of training data and test data that the model
  hasn't seen yet to evaluate how good the model predicts unseen data
